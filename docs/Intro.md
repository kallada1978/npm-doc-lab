# Annie's Component Lab 

### A basic example of a component lab/design language system.

This is a bare bones example of a living style guide and component lab that provides a toolbox of components for reuse within a React app. Components are built and styled within this repo and this repo only! Check it out for examples and the code you need to implement that exact component in an app without re-writing anything new.
